					<p><h3>1.Use Email</h3></p>
				
				<p>Email is a lot like regular mail and you can use it in many of the same ways. You'll need to sign up with an email service in order to get an address, though. Many email services are free and good ones include GMail and Outlook.com. When you go to check your email, you will go to the website for the service you signed up with and only the service you signed up with in order to read your mail.</p>

				<ul>
					
					<li>
						Email addresses don't look like street addresses. They are in a format like yourname@website.com. For example, the email to reach us here at wikiHow is wiki@wikihow.com. If your name is John Doe and you sign up with Gmail, your address could look like JohnDoe@gmail.com, JDoe@gmail.com, JohnD@gmail.com, or even something totally different like WarVet63@gmail.com.
					</li>
				</ul>

					<p><h3>2.Use Social Media</h3></p>
				

				<p>Social media is a term that encompasses a lot of different kind of websites, all for connecting and communicating with other people. Commonly used forms of social media include:

				<ul>
				<li>
					Facebook, which is used for lots of different purposes, from messaging to sharing pictures and videos.

					<p><h3>3.Read or Write Blogs</h3></p>
					<p>A blog, which was derived from the term web log, is an online journal. You can put text, pictures, and even videos in a blog. You can write your own or you can read someone else's. Blogs cover all sorts of different subjects, and are starting to replace certain sections of the newspaper in their function.</p>
				
                </ul>
                
                <br>

                <p><h3>4.Chat!</h3></p>

                <p>You can use the internet to talk directly with people you know (or even people you don't know). If you want to talk face-to-face or with voice like a phone, you can use services like Skype, which is often free or a low price. You can also type-chat, which is like talking but with just text, using a number of different services (like AOL's Instant Messenger service AIM).</p>
