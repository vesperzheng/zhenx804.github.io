    <p><h3>1.Find Professional Services</h3></p>

    <p>The internet is quickly becoming like a giant directory. Most professional services these days either have a website or at least a Google listing, so that you can easily get addresses and contact information, as well as hours and pricing. You can even use some websites to get recommendations, like AngiesList.com.</p>

<p><h3>2.Take Classes</h3></p>

<p>You can take full university courses or even just free courses online, if you want to learn a new skill or keep your brain active. You can find free courses from major universities on websites like Coursera, but actual degree programs online usually cost money.</p>


<p><h3>3.Learn New Things</h3></p>

<p>If you're in the mood for more of a lecture than a full class, you can also find this kind of bite-size info on the internet. Go to websites like TED to see interesting lectures from some of the best minds in the world, for free. You can learn loads of basic skills (and not-so-basic ones!) on websites like this one, wikiHow. You can also find websites like Wikipedia, which is a free online encyclopedia and contains a vast wealth of information.. YouTube has lots of information and entertainment in video format.</p>

<p><h3>4.Learn About Your Family History</h3></p>

<p>If you're interested in your family history, you can do research about where you and your family come from. There are lots of ancestry websites which can provide not only information but also sometimes things like pictures or draft cards. Try Ancestry.com, FamilySearch.org, and EllisIsland.org. Many publicly available census records are also online.</p>
