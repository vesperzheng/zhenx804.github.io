			SEX sold fetish and bondage wear supplied by existing specialist labels such as Atomage, She-And-Me and London Leatherman as well as designs by McLaren and Westwood. Among customers at SEX were the four original members of <a class=band href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> (the bass-player Glen Matlock was an employee as a sales assistant on Saturdays).
