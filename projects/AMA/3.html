      My biggest insecurity is my face. I have never liked how I looked for the past twenty years and I feel nervous in front of camera. I think it gets pretty serious sometimes because I always hesitated to post my pictures on any social media. Even when I think I look good in a picture I immediately feel like it's just because of the angle and I look nothing like that in real life.
